# Expense Tracker

This project implements an Expense Tracker system using Python, incorporating two classes: `Expense` and `ExpenseDatabase`. The `Expense` class models individual financial expenses, while the `ExpenseDatabase` class manages a collection of expenses.

## Expense Class

### Attributes
- `id`: A unique identifier generated as a UUID string.
- `title`: A string representing the title of the expense.
- `amount`: A float representing the amount of the expense.
- `created_at`: A timestamp indicating when the expense was created (UTC).
- `updated_at`: A timestamp indicating the last time the expense was updated (UTC).

### Methods
1. `__init__`: Initializes the attributes.
2. `update`: Allows updating the title and/or amount, updating the `updated_at` timestamp.
3. `to_dict`: Returns a dictionary representation of the expense.
4. `__repr__`: Returns a string representation of the expense.

## ExpenseDatabase Class

### Attributes
- `expenses`: A list storing `Expense` instances.

### Methods
1. `__init__`: Initializes the list.
2. `add_expense`: Adds an expense to the database.
3. `remove_expense`: Removes an expense from the database.
4. `get_expense_by_id`: Retrieves an expense by ID.
5. `get_expense_by_title`: Retrieves expenses by title (returning a list).
6. `to_dict`: Returns a list of dictionaries representing expenses.
